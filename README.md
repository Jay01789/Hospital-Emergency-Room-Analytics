# 📊 Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analytics – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes **Emergency Room (ER) operational data spanning 19 months**, covering **9,216 unique patients**. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate patient flow, wait times, satisfaction levels, referral patterns, and patient demographics to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **patient wait times** and **satisfaction levels**
- Identify **peak days and peak hours** in the ER
- Understand **departmental referral patterns**
- Examine **patient demographics** by age group and race
- Compare **admitted vs treated and released** patients
- Provide insights to improve **staffing efficiency and patient care**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation
- **DAX** – Measures and calculated columns
- **Excel / CSV** – Data source and documentation

## 📊 Dashboards Overview

**Monthly View**  
Tracks key ER metrics on a month-by-month basis, including patient admissions, age distribution, departmental referrals, timeliness, gender and race demographics, and patient volume by day and hour.

**Consolidated View**  
Provides a high-level summary of emergency room performance over a selectable date range, aggregating all key operational and demographic metrics.

**Patient Details**  
Displays patient-level information in a detailed table, including demographics, wait time, referral department, and admission status for in-depth analysis.

## 📊 Dashboards Included
The Power BI report contains interactive dashboards focused on:
